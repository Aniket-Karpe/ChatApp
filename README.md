## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the repository** to your local machine.
2.  **Set up Firebase:**
    *   Create a new project in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
    *   Add an Android app to your Firebase project.
    *   Download the `google-services.json` file and place it in your `app` directory.
    *   Enable Authentication and Realtime Database in the Firebase console.
3.  **Configure Android Studio:**
    *   Import the project in Android Studio.
    *   Ensure all dependencies are correctly set up by syncing the Gradle project.
4.  **Run the app** on an emulator or physical device.

## üìÅ File Structure
* `com.astech.chatapp`:
    *   `adapters`:
        *  `ChatAdapter.kt` : Provides the adapter for displaying chat messages in the RecyclerView [29, 30, 39]
        *  `UserAdapter.kt` : Provides the adapter for displaying a list of users [33, 40, 41].
    *  `databinding`: Automatically generated classes that enable interaction with view layouts [1, 29-33].
    *  `models`:
        * `ChatMessage.kt`: Defines the structure of a chat message [25, 26, 35].
        * `Message.kt`: Defines the structure of a message [25, 26].
        * `User.kt`: Defines the structure of a user profile [10, 25-27].
    *   `view`:
        *    `ChatListFragment.kt`: Displays a list of users and allows users to start a chat with other users [9, 15, 33].
        *   `ChatFragment.kt`: Displays the chat interface and handles sending and receiving messages [29, 34, 36, 39].
        *    `LoginFragment.kt`: Handles user login functionality [1, 3, 23].
        *    `SignupFragment.kt`: Handles user registration functionality [21, 31, 42, 43].
        *    `SplashFragment.kt`:  Displays a splash screen when the app is launched and navigates to the login or chat list screen based on login status [32, 44, 45].
    *   `MainActivity.kt`: The main activity of the app. Requests FCM token [16, 17].
    *   `MyFirebaseMessagingService.kt`: Handles Firebase Cloud Messaging, specifically push notifications [18-20].

## üñºÔ∏è UI Components

*   `FragmentChatBinding`: Layout for the chat screen, including the message list and input area [6, 29, 30, 34-36].
*   `FragmentLoginBinding`: Layout for the login screen with email and password fields [1, 3, 23, 24, 46, 47].
*   `FragmentSignupBinding`: Layout for the signup screen, including fields for username, email, password, and profile image selection [27, 31, 42].
*   `FragmentChatListBinding`: Layout for the chat list screen, including a list of users and a search view [9, 13, 15, 33].
*   `FragmentSplashBinding`: Layout for the splash screen that is shown when the app starts [32, 38].
*   `user_item.xml`: Layout for the user item in the user list [48].

## üîë Firebase Integration

*   **Authentication:** Uses `FirebaseAuth` for user authentication [2, 25-27].
*   **Realtime Database:**  Uses `FirebaseDatabase` to store and retrieve chat messages [6, 8, 10, 12, 34, 35, 49].
    *   Messages are stored under the `chats` node, with separate child nodes for each unique sender and receiver combination.
*   **Firestore:** Used to store user data [9, 27, 28]
*   **Cloud Messaging:**  Uses `FirebaseMessaging` for handling push notifications [16, 18].

## üí° Key Concepts

*   **Fragments:** The app uses fragments to create modular UI components, which helps in managing the UI and navigation [1, 29-33].
*   **Adapters:** `ChatAdapter` and `UserAdapter` are responsible for binding data to the `RecyclerView` and updating the UI when the data changes [29, 30, 40, 50].
*   **Real-Time Updates:** `addValueEventListener` is used to listen for changes in the database, which allows real-time updates in the UI [4-7].
*    **User IDs:** User IDs are used to create unique chat rooms to separate conversation data. [39].
*   **Data Modeling:** Classes like `ChatMessage` and `User` are used to structure the data used in the application [25-27, 35].
*   **Asynchronous Operations:**  Uses Kotlin's `addOnCompleteListener` pattern to handle asynchronous operations, such as signing in, creating users, and updating the user profile [21-23].

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Issues and Future Enhancements

*   **Image Loading:**  Image loading with Glide or Picasso needs to be implemented. [41]
*   **Message Delivery Status:** Add message delivery and read receipts.
*   **Error Handling:** Improve error handling for various scenarios.
*   **UI/UX Improvements:** Further enhance UI/UX for better user engagement.
*   **Group Chat:** Implement group chat functionality.
*   **Media Sharing:** Add functionality for sharing images, videos, and audio.
*   **Data Validation:** Implement more data validation before submitting data to firebase.
